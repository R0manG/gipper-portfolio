# Lefthandyman AI & Cloud Platform

## Overview

Lefthandyman is a handyman services business based in Iowa. This project is my effort to design and build a modern, AI-augmented platform to help the owner (my brother) manage:

- Customer requests
- Job quoting and estimation
- Scheduling
- Basic CRM and follow-up

It serves two purposes:
1. Deliver real value to a small business.
2. Act as a portfolio project demonstrating my skills in AI, cloud, and technical program management.

---

## Goals (Phase 1 – MVP)

- Create a simple public-facing website describing services and contact options.
- Build an intake flow to capture customer requests (form or chatbot).
- Store requests in a backend (e.g., Firebase, Supabase, Airtable).
- Experiment with AI-assisted quoting to help estimate time and cost for jobs.

---

## Future Enhancements (Phase 2+)

- AI assistant to triage customer requests and ask clarifying questions.
- Photo-based estimate helper (upload an image → AI suggests rough effort range).
- Lightweight scheduling system to propose time windows.
- Admin dashboard for the owner to manage jobs, customers, and status.
- Integrations with email / SMS for reminders and confirmations.

---

## Tech Stack (Planned / In Progress)

- **Frontend:** Simple web front end (TBD – could be static, React, or a site builder).
- **Backend:** Firebase / Supabase / Airtable for initial data storage.
- **AI:** Google AI (Gemini) for text-based estimation and task breakdowns.
- **Cloud:** Google Cloud Platform (long-term deployment target).

## My Role

- Defined the business name and secured the domain.
- Stood up the initial website.
- Assisted with LLC formation paperwork (Iowa).
- Acting as a one-person product owner, architect, and builder:
  - Gathering requirements from the business owner.
  - Designing the customer and admin flows.
  - Prototyping AI and backend integrations.
  - Documenting decisions, trade-offs, and roadmaps.

## TPM / PM Focus

This project is also designed to show how I:
- Translate business needs into technical requirements.
- Scope and prioritize features into phases (MVP first).
- Select technologies that balance speed, cost, and maintainability.
- Communicate clearly through documentation and diagrams.
- Iterate based on real feedback from a real customer (the business owner).

---

## Next Steps

- Document initial user stories and use cases.
- Choose and set up the backend (e.g., Firebase or Supabase).
- Build the first intake flow (web form or simple AI-assisted form).
- Start experimenting with AI-assisted quoting logic using Gemini.
